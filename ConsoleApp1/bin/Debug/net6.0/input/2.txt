Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.
It was a dream, he told himself firmly. I dreamed a giant called
Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When
I open my eyes Ill be at home in my cupboard.
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.
And theres Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry
thought, his heart sinking. But he still didnt open his eyes. It had
been such a good dream.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
All right, Harry mumbled, Im getting up.
He sat up and Hagrids heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full
of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the
collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the
window, a newspaper held in its beak.
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large
balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window
and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didnt wake up. The owl then
fluttered on to the floor and began to attack Hagrids coat.
