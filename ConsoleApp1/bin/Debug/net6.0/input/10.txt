A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they
were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were
sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large
ledgers, weighing coins on brass scales, examining precious stones
through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading
off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out
of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.
