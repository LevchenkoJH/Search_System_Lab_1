A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying
Eeylops Owl Emporium – Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown and Snowy.
Several boys of about Harrys age had their noses pressed against a
window with broomsticks in it. Look, Harry heard one of them
say, the new Nimbus Two Thousand – fastest ever – There were
shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver
instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with
barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes, tottering piles of spell books,
quills and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.
