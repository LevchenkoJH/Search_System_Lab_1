passers-by stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the
little town to the station. Harry couldnt blame them. Not only
was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, â€˜See
that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?
Hagrid, said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, did you
say there are dragons at Gringotts?
Well, so they say, said Hagrid. Crikey, Id like a dragon.
