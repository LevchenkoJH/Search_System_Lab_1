Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all Harry
had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops
and music stores, hamburger bars and cinemas, but nowhere that
looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.
Could there really be piles of
wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops
that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some
huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadnt
known that the Dursleys had no sense of humour, he might have
thought so yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told
him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldnt help trusting him.
